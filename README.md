# pywhois

One python whois package to rule them all.

## Immediate TO-DO

- complete the test with 100,000 random websites with many modern TLDs 

- break the code down in to separate files 

- refactor the code in each file

- comb through the issues in the origin i.e. joepie91/python-whois 

## Goals

These are in the honor of the original master of this beast (and trust me, a beast it is). 

- 100% coverage of WHOIS formats

- Accurate and complete data

- Consistently functional parsing; constant tests to ensure the parser isn't accidentally broken

By the way, there is a great sense of humor in reading through the comments and codes. It's like going down to the crypt in the original Diablo.
