# pywhois

One python whois package to rule them all.

## Immediate TO-DO

- complete the test with 100,000 random websites with many modern TLDs 

- break the code down in to separate files 

- refactor the code in each file

- comb through the issues in the origin i.e. joepie91/python-whois 

## Future Goals

These are in the honor of the original master of this beast (and trust me, a beast it is). 

- 100% coverage of WHOIS formats

- Accurate and complete data

- Consistently functional parsing; constant tests to ensure the parser isn't accidentally broken

By the way, there is a great sense of humor in reading through the comments and codes. It's like going down to the crypt in the original Diablo. And yea, accurate and complete data is impossible as the nics themselves don't have complete data (depending on the country). But gotta love that spirit.
